## The Process
The stages below represent the end-to-end process of every BI project, which is consistent across other projects I've developed:
- Requirements Gathering: This phase involves gathering and documenting the specific requirements for the report.
- Creating Technical Specifications: Based on the requirements, technical specifications are created to outline how the report will be developed.
- Report Development: The actual development of the report takes place, including data integration, visualization creation, and dashboard design.
- User Acceptance Testing (UAT): The report is tested by end users to ensure it meets the requirements and functions correctly.
- Deployment: Once the report passes UAT, it is deployed to the production environment for use by stakeholders.
- Maintenance: Ongoing maintenance and updates to the report are performed as needed to ensure it remains accurate and relevant.

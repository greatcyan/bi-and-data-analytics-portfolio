## Development Cost Center Analytics

This single-page Power BI report aims to provide an analysis of monthly costs and expenses related to development cost centers. The goal is to streamline the process of creating the monthly expenses report, which was previously done manually and took 1-2 weeks to complete. With this Power BI report, all manual data processing is automated, including the refresh schedule. Overall, the report reduces processing time from 2 weeks to 5 minutes. Other benefits include improved data accuracy, intuitive design, the capability for variance analysis, and Row-Level Security.

## The Process
The stages below represent the end-to-end process of every BI project, which is consistent across other projects I've developed:
- Requirements Gathering: This phase involves gathering and documenting the specific requirements for the report.
- Creating Technical Specifications: Based on the requirements, technical specifications are created to outline how the report will be developed.
- Report Development: The actual development of the report takes place, including data integration, visualization creation, and dashboard design.
- User Acceptance Testing (UAT): The report is tested by end users to ensure it meets the requirements and functions correctly.
- Deployment: Once the report passes UAT, it is deployed to the production environment for use by stakeholders.
- Maintenance: Ongoing maintenance and updates to the report are performed as needed to ensure it remains accurate and relevant.

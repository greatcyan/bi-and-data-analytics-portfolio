### Overview
The goal of this dashboard is to aid the authorities of Cebu Province in resource allocation, planning, and comparing demographics of each municipality and city. It also highlights the interplay among unique tourist attractions, population size, infrastructure, business climate, and talent outputs.

### The Final Output
The dashboard tab is the main tab of the workbook. It is a dynamic dashboard that allows users to select specific municipalities or cities, and the visuals automatically change, which is useful for comparative analysis, providing quick insights about the data. The dashboard uses visual hierarchies so that users can easily explore and understand the data.

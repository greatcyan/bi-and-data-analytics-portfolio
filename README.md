## BI Analyst | Power BI Developer 
I've worked in technical and analytical roles for over a decade and data has been central to my careerâ€”I've used it to analyze failures, improve tasks and processes with spreadsheets and macros, and create data analysis and visualizations. I also have experience in automating processes and developing dashboards using the Microsoft Power Platform.

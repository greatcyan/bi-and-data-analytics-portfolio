## Occupancy Cost Center Report
This report provides analysis of the monthly costs and expenses related to Occupancy cost centers. The design is aligned to the the stakeholders request to show costs and expenses by general ledger, prior year and current year comparison, and capability to drill down the details, allowing stakeholders a better understanding of costs.

### The Process: 
The data source is extracted from SAP Business Warehouse, normalized into different tables grouped by geographical categories, and saved into Power BI dataflows. Measures and calculations are then implemented using DAX and data modeling. Once the data is cleaned and finalized, the dashboard design is performed based on stakeholders' requirements. Once the values and presentation are validated, the report is deployed and can now be shared with end-users for their reporting needs.

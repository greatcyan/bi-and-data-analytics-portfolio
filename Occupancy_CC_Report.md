## Occupancy Cost Center Report
This is a sigle page report aim to provide analysis of the monthly costs and expenses related to Occupancy cost centers. The design is aligned to the the stakeholders request to show costs and expenses by general ledger, prior year and current year comparison, and capability to drill down the details, allowing stakeholders a better understanding of costs in depth. 

### The Process: 

After understanding the business requirements, I proceed to develop the dashboard. First, the data is extracted from SAP Business Warehouse, then normalized into different tables grouped by geographical categories, and saved into Power BI dataflows. Next, I implement measures and calculations using DAX and data modeling. Once the data is cleaned and finalized, I design the dashboard according to stakeholders' requirements. Finally, after validating the values and presentation, the report is deployed and can be shared with end-users for their reporting needs.

### The Stakeholders Expected Result:

The dashboard allows end-users to explore insights based on their preferred parameters and slicers. It is designed perfectly, applying visual hierarchies for better data comprehension.

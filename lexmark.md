## Finance Business Analyst
I am currently connected with Lexmark, where my role as a Finance Business Analyst involves collaborating with the finance and accounting teams. My responsibilities include gathering business requirements, creating technical specifications, translating these requirements into a business intelligence (BI) context, and providing solutions. These solutions often include process automation and the development of custom reports and dashboards. Additionally, I handle ad hoc requests as they arise.

## Career Site Analytics

This Power BI report was requested by the HR department to gain insights into web traffic for career site analytics. It aims to provide a comprehensive view of the website's performance, including visitor demographics, popular pages, and traffic sources. The report will help HR make informed decisions to optimize the career site and attract top talent.

In this project, the data source was provided by HR and saved in a SharePoint folder. The data originates from SEO and is subsequently transformed and analyzed using Power BI to enhance data comprehension and quickly visualize traffic trends.

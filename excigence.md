### The "Test Program Loader" GUI

This app is used to manage test scripts for testing electrical devices. It also features a dynamic selection option that allows users to choose specific test files based on their needs. The analyze and visualize data function is also embedded in the GUI which automatically display the summary logs and the chart.
